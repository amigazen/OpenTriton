    You  may  include  the  directory  'Triton'  (which  is  included in this
directory)  completely  and  unmodified in the distributions of your programs
which require Triton.

    The  directory  contains the general OS2.04+ version of triton.library, a
short  information  about obtaining a full version of Triton and a script for
Commodore's Installer to install triton.library.
